# Security Principles

## Core Philosophy

### Zero Trust Architecture

- Trust nothing by default
- Verify everything
- Minimize attack surface
- Compartmentalize systems

### Privacy First

- Data minimization
- Anonymous by default
- Secure by design
- User sovereignty

### Open Security

- Open source everything
- Community audited
- Transparent processes
- Documented decisions

## Security Layers

### 1. Identity & Access

```mermaid

    A[Anonymous Identity] --> B[Zero Knowledge Proofs]
    B --> C[Access Control]
    C --> D[Authorization]
    D --> E[Audit Trails]
```

#### Implementation

- Public key infrastructure
- Anonymous credentials
- Role-based access
- Minimal permissions

### 2. Data Protection

    A[Client Data] --> B[E2E Encryption]
    B --> C[Zero Knowledge Storage]
    C --> D[Secure Transport]
    D --> E[Verified Delivery]
```

#### Implementation

- End-to-end encryption
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Secure key management
- Perfect forward secrecy

### 3. Network Security

```mermaid

    A[P2P Network] --> B[Onion Routing]
    B --> C[Traffic Analysis Prevention]
    C --> D[DDoS Protection]
    D --> E[Network Isolation]
```

#### Implementation

- Tor integration
- P2P encryption
- Traffic obfuscation
- Network segmentation

### 4. Platform Security

    A[Secure Architecture] --> B[Hardened Systems]
    B --> C[Vulnerability Management]
    C --> D[Incident Response]
    D --> E[Security Updates]
```

## Security Practices

### Development

   - Code review
   - Static analysis
   - Dynamic testing
   - Dependency scanning

2. Deployment

   - Secure configurations
   - Container security
   - Infrastructure hardening
   - Update management

3. Operations
   - Monitoring
   - Incident response
   - Backup procedures
   - Recovery plans

### User Security

1. Authentication

   - Strong passwords
   - 2FA/MFA
   - Hardware keys
   - Biometric options

2. Communication

   - Encrypted channels
