NAME
     nullsect            digital liberation collective

SYNOPSIS
     A framework for breaking free from systems of control

DESCRIPTION
     We emerge at the intersection of consciousness and memetic evolution,
     a collective dedicated to understanding and breaking free from systems
     of control. We refuse the comfortable illusions of prescribed reality,
     choosing instead to decode existence from first principles.
